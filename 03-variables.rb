# snake_case is the norm in Ruby variable naming
#Theres no let, no var, no const
_my_name = "Wesley" # Variables can be changed, no const/let
_my_name = "Anh"
puts _my_name
# Constants start with a capital letter
# All constants should have only capital letters
# Unlike javascript, they CAN and WILL be overwritten
# const myName = "Bryan Gomes"
MY_NAME = "Danek"
MY_NAME = "Archana" # You will receive a warning if you override a constant

puts MY_NAME # Constant overridden
